        Smile denty Clinic has been the best change our family has made,
        I have been terrified going to the dentist for years, and I have twin girls that hated going to the dentist.
        We first decided to give Smile denty Clinic a try with our girls after hearing how wonderful of a hygienist Jenn is.
        Since then our entire family has switched also, and we have had nothing but amazing care from everyone we have dealt with.
        I no longer fear going to the dentist and am able to relax while getting work done.
        The atmosphere and the staff there are so welcoming. We would highly recommend Smile denty Clinic to anyone!

        As a college student living on my own for the first time,
        I was worried about finding a good dentist in town. I'm really happy that I ended up at The Smile denty Clinic. 
        The building is newly redone and the staff is super friendly and knowledgeable.
        Everyone was really helpful with every question I had and even helped me out with the things I should know but didn't!
        Plus they have little Tv's in the rooms so you don't have to be bored while they clean your teeth.

        The Smile denty Clinic is a very safe, remote, and comfortable.
        it was little dirty in terms of washrooms! 
        The employees are very kind, reassuring, and easy-going. During my appointment, I felt comfortable 
        and safe with my surroundings. The MDC is very cleanly and organized with a smooth flow of patient traffic. 
        I recommend this clinic to all..thanks a lot to Smile denty Clinic!

        I was in for a 6 month check-up today. 
        The hygienist & dentist took excellent care of me! Cleaning & check-up went smoothly with few concerns. 
        Problem areas were politely addressed with my options. I will be back in 6 months!

    Thank you Dr.jayesh for the great experience and quality work you have done on my teeth. 
    I am usually apprehensive about needles and it was no sweat at all. In fact, 
    I am ready for the next needle, thanks to your gentle touch.
    My family and I have been pleased with your professional, yet personable, service. See you soon.

    As we come to the close of 2018, 
    many of us reflect on the blessings we have received during this year. 
    How grateful I am that I can cite my experience with Dr.lisa and her staff at Smile denty Clinic as among my blessings! 
    From my very first visit at the office,
    I was made to feel welcome and comfortable both by the friendly competence of the staff 
    and the pleasant environment of the offiice itself. Dr.lisa inspires the utmost confidence by her smile which 
    is so wide that it seems apt to describe it as extending "from sea to shining sea" and by her wealth of knowledge, 
    skill, and professionalism. Kudos and the highest recommendation to Dr.lisa and everyone at Smile denty Clinic!
