    <h1 style="text-align: center;">5 TIPS FOR CHOOSING YOUR DENTIST</h1>
    <img src="dentist.jpg" class="center">
    <h2 style="margin-left: 20px;">Here are 5 tips for choosing your new dentist:
    </h2>
    <h3 style="margin-left: 20px;">1. Look for verified review services</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 20px;">Many doctors use verified review services to allow patients to have a clear insight into the
  level of care they provide. Using reviews is a great way to start getting to know your provider.
  At Dental Associates we use Press Ganey, a nationally-recognized patient experience firm, to survey our patients. 
  This helps us provide honest and transparent feedback to our patients and potential patients.</p>
 <h3 style="margin-left: 20px;"> 2. Consider location and convenience</h3>
 <p style="margin-left: 20px;">Many parents have limited time to take off work, or we don’t want a dental visit to be a reason our children miss school. 
 Choosing a dentist who is close in proximity to your house or work and offers multiple specialties will save you time in the
 long-run when it comes to driving to and from appointments and scheduling.
 Dental Associates clinics offer a variety of specialties from pediatric dentistry and orthodontics to endodontics and periodontics</p>
 <h3 style="margin-left: 20px;">3. Find out if the provider is in-network</h3>
 <p style="margin-left: 20px;">Normally a quick search on the clinic’s website, a call to their patient care services, 
 or consulting with your insurance provider can help determine if the provider is in-network. 
 If you don’t have dental insurance, consider CarePlus Dental Plans. CarePlus offers competitive rates and coverage,
  and Dental Associates is proud to be its sole provider. In some cases, CarePlus can even be used alongside your existing insurance.
 </p>
 <h3 style="margin-left: 20px;">4. Review training, certifications, and specialties</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">At Dental Associates, we offer videos of each of our providers to allow you to get to know them prior
     to meeting them in person. You can also view their education, certifications, and which languages they speak. 
     When you know a little bit more about who your provider is and what they can offer you, you’re more likely to have 
     a positive experience. Whether you’re looking for a provider at Dental Associates or elsewhere, learning more about
      your provider before stepping foot into the clinic is a great way to help ease your mind. 
</p>
<h3 style="margin-left: 20px;">5. Ask friends, family, or coworkers for referrals to their favorite providers</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">When people we know and trust have positive experiences with their providers, 
    we feel more at ease about selecting to see them ourselves. The way a provider makes someone feel when 
    they’re in the chair or the clinic is very important. Leverage the experiences of others in making decisions 
    about your new provider to feel more confident about your care.
