    <h1 style="text-align: center;">STRAIGHT TALK ABOUT PLANNING FOR BRACES</h1>
    <h2 style="margin-left: 20px;">how to plan for the cost of braces</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">Planning for the cost of braces, or orthodontic treatment is something we often forget to take into consideration. 
        With the increased popularity of orthodontic treatment, many parents have begun to expect this additional expense 
        and are looking for ways to plan effectively and prepare for a treatment that will set the foundation for their childâ€™s smile.
   </p>
   <h2 style="margin-left: 20px;">PLAN PLAN PLAN!!</h2>
   <p style="margin-left: 20px;">The American Association of Orthodontists recommends that kids begin seeing an orthodontist at age 7.
     These early exams are often complementary diagnoses conducted by a licensed professional that most often result
      in future observations until all permanent have erupted.  Though if your orthodontist diagnoses skeletal issues, 
      possible tooth impactions, or trauma to the teeth, they may prevent the need for expensive future surgeries or a 
      lifetime of oral health issues with a short phase one treatment.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">Based on your initial visit, I recommend starting to save as often as you are able.
     Being able to pay for the cost of braces upfront is ideal and often less stressful for parents or individuals. 
     When that is not possible, payment plans may be available depending on the cost and need.

<h2 style="margin-left: 20px;">consider payment plans!</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">There are also many financing options that individuals can use to reduce the cost of braces, 
    bringing what may seem like a high-ticket price down to reasonable monthly payments.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">A lot of dental work and orthodontia can be paid for using Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) or Health Savings Accounts 
    (HSA) which provides additional flexibility in payment methods.
</p>
<h2 style="margin-left: 20px;">So, How Much do Braces Cost?</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">The cost of orthodontic treatment really varies depending on the complexity of the case. 
    An initial limited Phase I treatment in adolescence to prevent future surgeries, extractions or trauma to the 
    teeth may range between $1,000 and $3,500.

    The cost of teenage or adult orthodontic treatment may range between $5,000 - $10,000, depending on 
    corrective work needed. With the median cost often ranging between $5,000 - $6,500. Orthodontic treatment
     is spread out over time, so financing options are available to make it more affordable. Your orthodontist will 
     help to identify the best course of action for your specific needs and will work to utilize a cost-effective method.
    
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
    Working with your health care provider and Patient Care Coordinator, you can ask about payment options 
    and together work to identify the various options for corrective work.
