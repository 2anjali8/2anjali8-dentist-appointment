    <h1 style="text-align: center;">ORAL CANCER INDICATORS</h1>
    <h2 style="margin-left:20px;">oral cancer signs</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">According to the American Cancer Society, 
    an estimated 53,260 people will get oral cancer in 2020 and 10,750 people will die from these cancers.
     Oral cancer has a high survival rate when caught early, which is why Dental Associates dentists pledge
      to monitor our patients for signs of oral cancer at each routine exam.</p>
    <h2 style="margin-left: 20px;">oral cancer exams</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">With each routine dental exam, we perform a soft tissue exam as well
         to look for any sign of oral cancer. During these soft tissue exams, we feel for lumps or abnormalities
          that could be a sign of something more. In between exams, and especially if youâ€™re a high-risk patient 
          (those who have a family history of oral cancer, or are a smoker or chew tobacco), you can also perform 
          self-exams to check yourself for signs of oral cancer. To do this, simply use a light to look around your 
          mouth and monitor for any of the below symptoms. You can also feel around your jawbone and neck area for any 
          abnormal lumps. If you do find an area of concern, make an appointment with your dentist immediately to have it
           examined further.
